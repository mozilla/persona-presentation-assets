This repository contains assets (mostly images) that have been used in presentations
for Persona.

# HOWTO

When adding a new asset to this repository, please include the following in the commit
message:

1. the URL where that resource comes from (if applicable)
2. the license that the resource is under

This will allow people who reuse these assets to credit the author properly (for
example in a "photo credits" slide) and to ensure that the asset licenses are compatible
with the license of the presentation itself.
